<h2>What is the WEB?</h2>
<p>The <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank" title="WEB wikipedia page">World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, commonly known as the Web, is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
  (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible via the Internet.
  The resources of the WWW may be accessed by users via a software application called a web browser.</p>
<p>English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.
  The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.
  The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.</p>
<p>Web resources may be any type of downloadable media, but web pages are hypertext media which have been formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
  Such formatting allows for embedded hyperlinks which contain URLs and permit users to easily navigate to other web resources.
  In addition to text, web pages may contain images, video, audio, and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content.</p>
